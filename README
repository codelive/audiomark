Audiomark is an incomplete attempt at implementing an audio watermarker.  It requires libsndfile and fftw3 to be compiled, and had only been tested on ubuntu.

To use it you have to make a watermark configuration file, which contains several pieces of information necessary to embed data, including the string you wish to embed.
